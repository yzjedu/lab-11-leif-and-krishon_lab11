I was supposed to learn how to use a file with morse code conversions to convert a file with morse code.
Procedure: We began by working on solutions to the various problems and figuring out how to include them in the code.
Next, we did a rough draft of the algorithm and code. Last, we improved the algorithm and code. The key concepts explored
were file manipulation. The results were different than I expected since Leif headed the code, but it was a similar concept to what I envisioned.
We tried various test cases. I liked working with Leif, but I wish we had more communication.
